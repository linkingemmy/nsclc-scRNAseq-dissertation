# Single-Cell Transcriptomic Profiling of Immune Cell Heterogeneity in Early-Stage NSCLC

This repository contains the analysis code used for my MSc Bioinformatics dissertation.

## Project Overview
The study investigates early alterations in cellular composition, functional immune states,
and ligand–receptor communication in the NSCLC tumour microenvironment using scRNA-seq data.

## Data Sources
Publicly available scRNA-seq datasets were obtained from GEO:
- GEO accession: GSE117570
- GEO accession: GSE131907

## Methods
- Quality control and filtering
- Data integration using scVI
- Cell-type annotation
- Differential abundance analysis
- Ligand–receptor interaction analysis

## Repository Structure
- `scripts/` – Analysis scripts
- `notebooks/` – Jupyter/R notebooks

## Requirements
- R (version 4.4.2) / Python (version 3.12.7)
